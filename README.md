#This C++ program manages a simple to-do list using file handling. It includes functions to add, display, search, delete, and update tasks. Tasks are stored in a text file ("todo.txt"), with each task having a unique ID. User interaction is via a console menu, with options to perform various operations on tasks. Tasks can be added with confirmation, displayed with IDs, searched by ID, deleted with user confirmation, and updated by replacing task details in the file. The program maintains simplicity and uses recursive function calls for certain operations like updating tasks.
